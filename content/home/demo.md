`Explorers` tend to disregard existing and well applied methods and formulate new, different, better ideas. They are quick thinkers due to having extremely flexible minds, shifting among ideas and solution. 

Doing that, `Explorers` could be genuinely enthusiastic and energetic. In general, they are open to change, persistent, and they have bold persuasive power.
