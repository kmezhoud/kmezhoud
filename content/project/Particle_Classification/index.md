This [challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/tic-heap-cirta-particle-classification-challenge) is part of an effort to explore the use of machine learning to assist high energy physicists in discovering and characterizing new particles.  Particles are the tiny constituents of matter generated in a collision between proton bunches. Physicists at CERN study particles using particle accelerators.
The goal of this challenge is to build a machine learning model to read images of particles and identify their type.
