- Find all repeat motifs of DNA that have more or equal to 9 bases. Take Care about Overlapping

- There are 4 conventional bases: A,T,C,G. The script must work with upper and lower cases.

- The DNA is a double strand helix. If we look the repeats in one strand, automatically, we can deduce repeats in the second strand.

- The input of the script is a simple DNA sequence that can reach 1.000,000 bp.

- The output is a list of motifs with their lengths, sorted from longest to shortest.
