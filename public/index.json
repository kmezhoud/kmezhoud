You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Charts Academic supports the popular Plotly chart format.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026quot;chart\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\n  (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./line-chart.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-453786912', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  You might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\\\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\n1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams.

To close the application click on Quit in the Navigation bar and then click the Quit button on the left of the screen.

You can open this state file at a later time or on another computer to continue where you left off. You can also share the file with others that may want to replicate your analyses. As an example, load the state_file [`example.rda`](https://github.com/vnijs/radiant/blob/master/inst/examples/RadiantState.rda?raw=true) through the Data  Manage tab. Go to `Processing  View`, `Processing  Visualize` to see some of the settings. There is also a report in `R  Report` that was created using the bioCancer interface. The html file [`ExampleState.html`](https://github.com/vnijs/radiant/blob/master/inst/examples/RadiantState.html?raw=true) contains the output. Loading and saving state also works with Rstudio. If you start bioCancer from Rstudio and use   `Stop` to stop the app, lists called `r_data` and `r_state` will be put into Rstudio's global workspace. If you start bioCancer again using `bioCancer()` it will use these lists to restore state. This can be convenient if you want to make changes to a data file in Rstudio and load it back into bioCancer. Also, if you load a state file directly into Rstudio it will be used when you start bioCancer to recreate a previous state. ```r numericInput(\"sm_comp_value\", \"Comparison value:\", state_init('sm_comp_value',sm_args$comp_value)) ``` -- Acknowledgment bioCancer is a collaborative work .

The risks for the radiobiology workers have not been assessed sufficiently because measuring instruments fail to detect very low doses. This paper presents an investigation on the potential risks for radiobiology workers, due to the occupational exposure to low doses of irradiation. In this respect we used plasma samples from 16 subjects who were supposed to receive very low dose of irradiation in a longer time period. We used chromosomal aberrations, means of oxidative stress measurement and combined proteomics and bioinformatics in order to elucidate risks of such exposure. We found significant chromosome aberrations in lymphocytes and the increase of oxidative stress biomarkers in plasma. In addition, the proteomic analysis shows differentially regulated proteins from which three were verified by ELISA tests. This proteomic analysis picks out some interesting proteins that may belong to biomarkers panel of radiation exposure.","tags":null,"title":"Radiobiology worker risk assessment using stress indicators and proteomics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karim Mezhoud","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Before selecting potential candidate proteomic biomarkers, it is important to understand the broader context of how biological processes are regulated under different conditions or in different phenotypes. The enrichment of proteomic data consists of extracting as much biological meaning as possible from curated, pathway-based, functional protein interaction networks. Currently, most of the enrichment tools are intended for microarray data and require parametric data, whereas proteomic data are often nonparametric. In this study, we aimed to select a suite of interactive tools that can enrich proteomic results with a graphical overview. This facilitated diagnosis and interpretation prior to further analysis. From a list of proteins, a network was constructed using a map of the most severely disrupted biological process, and the disease entity was then identified on the basis of clinical data. Taken together, this graphical and interactive method ranks potential proteins via functional analysis in order to improve the choice of biomarkers for validation with the following advantages- 1) It adds neighbor proteins that are not selected by mass spectrometry analysis, but could in fact be key proteins; 2) pinpoints the biological process most often involved; and 3) predicts the most likely disease on the basis of clinical data.","tags":null,"title":"Graphical Identification of Cancer-Associated Gene Subnetworks Based on Small Proteomics Data Sets","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://kmezhoud.netlify.app/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
