      <description>&lt;p&gt;The dataset for this competition is a relational set of files describing customers&#39; orders over time. &lt;strong&gt;The goal of the competition is to predict which products will be in a user&amp;rsquo;s next order&lt;/strong&gt;. The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, we provide between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. We also provide the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders. For more information, see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; accompanying its public release.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Case of study explores and analyses data sets of restaurants reservations and activities for two distant touristic area in Japan. The data set covers information of two years.
The goal of this study is to predict restaurant activities depending of dataset history. The challenge is to decipher knowledge about the behaviors of the visitors in two distant areas depending in multiple parameter like weekend, holidays, whether, gender, kind of dishes and times.
The data set comes from kaggle competition named &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/c/recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Recruit restaurant visitor forecasting&lt;/a&gt;. This tutorial is inspired from the winner of this competition which is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Heads or Tails&lt;/a&gt;. All respect and thanks for his work and data exploratory and analysis. It could be considered as a lesson for bigger on data analysis using R programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
